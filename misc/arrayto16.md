# Arrayto16

### Arrayto16 Method in class Convert

**Input:** Integer Array

**Output:** Integer Array

```java
    public static int[] Arrayto16(int[] in) {
        int[] inp16 = new int[16];

        System.arraycopy(in, 0, inp16, 0, in.length);
        // arraycopy is used so that leading zeros is present
        
        return inp16;
    }
```

Generally, you may encounter situations where you want to give an input of less than 16 bits or the value in the integer parameter has leading zeros, this may lead to **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.** To avoid such issues, the method Arrayto16 is created, so that the size of the array is always 16. The arraycopy method from system is used to implement leading zeros.
